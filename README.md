 # Project name to be decided later (sorry)

## Description
This project is a syllabus-governed exam preparation platform designed for SJEC college students. It helps students study only what is relevant by enforcing syllabus rules, identifying repeated questions and important topics using past exam data. The platform removes the need for students to rely on multiple AI tools or chatbots to verify syllabus relevance, importance, or answer correctness.
