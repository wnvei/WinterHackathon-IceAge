 A–Demonstration (Compulsorily to be conducted):  
A1. Implement three nodes point –to–point networks with duplex links between them using NS2.   
       Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.  
A2. Implement transmission of ping messages/traceroute over a network topology consisting of 6  
       nodes using NS2 and find the number of packets dropped due to cong estion.  
B–Exercise (compulsorily to be conducted):  
B1. Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the bellman -ford algorithm  
B2. Write a program for congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.  
B3. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client -server program to make client sending the file name and  
       the server to send back the contents of the requested file if present.  
C–Structured Enquiry (compulsorily any 4 to be conducted):  
C1. Analyze network p ackets using Wireshark (IPv6, Ipv4, ICMP, and ICMP6).  
C2. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes using NS2 and plot  
       conges the window for different source/destination.  
C3. Develop a program such that client will sen d a simple ping message to a server and receive a  
       corresponding pong message back from the server using any programming message.  
C4. Implement IPv4 address classifier (A, B, C, D, and E) using any programming language.  
C5. Implement simple FTP prot ocol using any programming language.  
C6. Create  IPv4 or IPv6 packets using any programming language.
