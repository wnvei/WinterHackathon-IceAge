      "answer": "Registered designs are protected for 10 years initially, extendable by 5 years, offering a maximum protection of 15 years. For a design to be registrable, it should be novel, original, not previously published, and applied to an article via an industrial process. Also, the features should be purely aesthetic, not functional, and should appeal to and be judged solely by the eye. Furthermore, it should not be contrary to public order or morality, should not be a mere mechanical device, and should not be a trademark or an artistic work already protected. \n\nNon-registrable designs include those against public moral values; designs that include flags, emblems, or signs of any country; and designs of integrated circuits. Also, industrial designs that describe the process of making an article, and certain artistic works such as paintings, sculptures, drawings, and photographs are not registrable. Trademarks are also excluded from industrial design registration."

      "answer": "An Industrial Design relates to the \\\"appearance of an article\\\" i.e. how the product looks and its design, but it doesn’t protect its technical or functional features i.e. how a product works. Industrial designs are applied to a variety of products of industry and handicraft. An industrial design consists of two -dimensional figures such as lines, color, patterns of an article as well it consists of three -dimensional figures such as the shape of an article. For example, two -dimensional figures – the pattern of textile, three -dimensional figure – round tail of a bike. \n\nNeed for protection of Industrial Designs:\n\n1.  **Customer Purchase Choice**: A customer’s purchase choice, purchase decision, and opinion about a product is based on the product or article aesthetics, i.e. appearance such as patterns, shapes, looks, colors, combinations, etc.\n2.  **Monetary Gain**: Industrial designs must be protected and registered in order to gain many benefits such as monetary gain, making a brand, etc.\n3.  **Quality Standard**: They also link a product with a particular quality standard based on the article’s appearance or product aesthetics.\n4.  **Differentiating Products**: For an enterprise, the design of a product is an uncomplicated or the simplest way of differentiating one product from other competing products.\n5.  **Prevent Copying**: companies making imitation products usually copy the design of a product, to gain value in the market share.\n6.  **Business Asset**: For business owners, a registration of an industrial design may be a valuable business asset.\n7.   **Influence Success**: The success of a product is usually influenced by its appearance in an aesthetic -driven consumer base, the looks of a fashionable product can often be equally or more important than its functionality.\n8.  **Exclusive Rights**: Obtaining exclusive rights to a product or an article with a particular appearance may result in a substantial return on the investment because it will allow you to prevent others from reproducing a popular design.\n9.  **Revenue Generator**\n10. **Return on Investments**\n11. **Promotes Brand Value**\n12. **Facilitates Marketing and Commercialization**\n13. **Unique Selling Propositions**\n14. **Reward and Encourages Creativity** industrial design protection rewards and encourages creativity and innovation to benefit the consumers and the public at large and thus leads to more attractive and diversified products.\n15. **Manufacturing Sector Benefits:** Protecting industrial designs may benefit the manufacturing and industrial sector as well as it injects into creativity it contributes to the development and enlargement of commercial activities, and build -up the potential of exports of national products. As the protection of industrial designs is relatively simple and inexpensive to develop. Hence they are rationally reachable to small and medium undertakings and even to the individual artists and craftsmen in both industrialized and developing countries."

      "answer": "India's Traditional Knowledge (TK), often developed over generations, is a valuable resource. Protecting it under the Intellectual Property (IP) regime is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Preventing Misappropriation:** Without protection, TK is vulnerable to being patented or commercially exploited by others without acknowledging or compensating the original holders. This is also called as biopiracy, and it can lead to economic loss and erosion of cultural heritage for local communities.\n2.  **Promoting Economic Growth:** By protecting TK, India can foster innovation and entrepreneurship based on its traditional knowledge systems. This can lead to the development of new products and services, creating economic opportunities for local communities and contributing to the country's economic growth.\n3.  **Safeguarding Cultural Heritage:** TK is an integral part of India's cultural identity and heritage. Protecting it under the IP regime helps preserve this heritage for future generations, ensuring its continued use and transmission. Landmark cases like the Turmeric and Neem patent cases showcase this need.\n4.  **Ensuring Equitable Benefit Sharing:** IP protection can facilitate benefit-sharing mechanisms, ensuring that local communities receive a fair share of the profits arising from the commercialization of their TK.\n5.  **Fostering Innovation and Creativity:** Protecting TK encourages further research and development in traditional knowledge systems, leading to new innovations and discoveries that can benefit society as a whole."

      "answer": "The steps involved in the literature review process are as follows:\n\n1.  **Select a topic**: Choose a topic that can be managed within the available timeframe. Establish research questions and organize the literature into logical categories around the subject/topic areas of these questions. Ensure that the research questions are specific enough to guide the search for relevant literature. It is important to understand the concept of 'broader' and 'narrower' terms, as a narrower topic makes it easier to limit the number of sources needed for a good survey of the literature.\n2.  **Identify the most relevant sources**: Use a variety of resources to locate books, journals, and documents that contain useful information and ideas on the chosen topic. Include internet sites, theses & dissertations, conference papers, ePrints, and government or industry reports. Avoid relying solely on easily available electronic full-text material. Reference sources like dictionaries and encyclopedias can help with terminology and provide introductions to the topic with key references.\n3.  **Search and Refine**: Search databases that provide full-text access to articles and allow refinement of the search to 'peer-reviewed' journals. These journals undergo a rigorous quality assessment process by researchers or subject specialists before publication. Utilize operators like And, Or, and Not, along with wildcards and logical brackets, to refine the search. 'And' narrows the search, 'Or' expands it, and 'Not' excludes irrelevant information.\n4.  **Read and Analyze**: Read the literature and analyze it to find answers to questions such as whether there are gaps in the literature, where significant research has taken place, if there is consensus or debate on the topic, and which methodological approaches work best.\n5.  **Write the Literature Review**: Organize the review in a way that suits the project, such as centering it historically (how the topic has been dealt with over time), focusing on theoretical positions surrounding the topic (those for a position vs. those against), or emphasizing how each source contributes to the understanding of the project.  The literature review should include an introduction explaining how the review is organized, a body containing headings and subheadings that provide a map to show the various perspectives of the argument, and a summary."

      "answer": "Plagiarism is academic or literary theft, occurring intentionally or unintentionally, when someone uses another person’s language, ideas, or any other type of text material, figure, and graph which do not belong to common original knowledge without acknowledgement.\n\nKey practices to help prevent plagiarism include:\n\n1.  **Cite Sources:** Whenever you use someone else's ideas, words, or data, cite the source. This includes direct quotes, paraphrases, summaries, and even ideas that are not common knowledge. Use the appropriate citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) recommended by your institution or publisher.\n2.  **Understand Proper Paraphrasing:** When paraphrasing, rephrase the original text in your own words while retaining the meaning. Ensure that the structure and organization of the information are different from the original.\n3.  **Use Quotations:** When directly quoting a source, use quotation marks and provide the correct citation. This indicates that the exact words are from the original source.\n4.  **Manage References and Notes:** Keep thorough notes of all sources consulted during research. Record bibliographic information (author, title, publication date, etc.) to properly cite them later.\n5.  **Develop Your Own Ideas:** Focus on developing original thoughts and ideas backed by evidence and research. Combine information from various sources to create new insights and interpretations.\n6.  **Give Credit for Common Knowledge:** Information that is common knowledge or widely accepted facts (e.g., historical dates, scientific principles) doesn't require citation. However, if in doubt, it's better to cite the source.\n7.  **Use Plagiarism Detection Tools:** Before submitting your work, utilize plagiarism detection software or online tools to check for unintentional similarities with existing content.\n8.  **Seek Guidance:** If you're unsure about proper citation practices or how to use sources correctly, consult style guides, academic writing centers, or your instructors for guidance.\n9.  **Plan Ahead and Manage Time:** Procrastination can lead to rushed writing, increasing the likelihood of accidental plagiarism. Start your assignments early to have enough time for research, writing, and proper citation.\n10. **Review and Edit:** Always review your work before submission. Check citations, references, and quotations to ensure accuracy and completeness."

An invention must be new, involve an inventive step, and be capable of industrial application to be patented.\n\n2.  **Copyright:** Copyright protects original works of authorship, including literary, musical, dramatic, artistic works, sound recordings, cinematograph films, architectural works, and computer software. The holder has exclusive rights to modify, distribute, perform, create, display, and copy the work. Copyright grants author's lifetime coverage plus 60 years after death under certain classes whereas in other classes it is 60 years in toto.\n\n3.  **Trademark:** A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, or design that distinguishes the source of goods or services of one business from its competitors. The renewable term of registration of a trademark is ten years.\n\n4.  **Industrial Designs:** These protect the aesthetic or ornamental aspects of an article. The design law excludes functioning features and grants protection only to aesthetic appeals. Once a design is registered, the proprietor is afforded protection for an initial period of 10 years, which is extendable for a further period of 5 years.\n\n5.  **Geographical Indications:** These identify goods originating from a specific territory, region, or locality where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of such goods is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. A registered geographical indication is awarded protection for a term of ten years with the option of renewing and extending such protection for further tenures of ten years from the date of expiration of the original registration."

      "answer": "Based on the provided notes, here's an explanation of the absolute and relative grounds for refusal of registration of a trade mark. However, the notes DO NOT directly contain a section explicitly titled as \"absolute grounds and relative grounds for refusal of registration of a trade mark.\" Therefore, I have synthesised an answer based on potentially relevant information.\n\nTrademarks:\n1.  A trademark (popularly known as brand name) is defined as a visual symbol (word, signature, name, device, label, numerals, or combination of colors) used to distinguish goods or services of one business from those of its competitors.\n2.  The Trade Marks Act 1999 specifies Trademarks as a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others, and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colors.\n3.  Eligibility Criteria: For goods/services to be legally classified as a Trademark, they need to fulfill conditions such as:\n * Distinctiveness: They need to be unique enough to identify it as a Trademark.\n * Non-Descriptiveness: They should not merely describe the goods or services.\n * No Similarity: The mark should not be deceptively similar to existing marks.\n4.  The Trade Mark Rules 2017:\n*Simplified the process with fewer forms, encourages online filing with lower fees, and clarified fee structures, including concessions for startups and small enterprises.\n5.  The trademarks are classified based on their nature, purpose and distinctiveness. Some of the key trademark classifications discussed in the context are:\n * Product Marks.\n * Service Marks.\n * Collective Marks.\n * Certification Marks.\n * Well-Known Trademarks.\n * Shape Marks.\n * Sound Marks.\n * Color and Pattern Marks.\n\nThe Trademarks Rules 2017 aims at making the trademark registration procedure in India simpler, and startup-friendly. Trademarks also ensure legal protection, enhanced goodwill, and the potential for global registration advantages."
